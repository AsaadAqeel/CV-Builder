# Headless PDF Generation

This project now includes a script to generate a high-quality PDF of your CV using Puppeteer.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Setup

1.  Open a terminal in this directory.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To generate the PDF, run:

```bash
node generate-pdf.js
```

This will create `CV.pdf` in the same directory.

## Customization

You can modify `generate-pdf.js` to change PDF options like margins, format, or to inject specific data before printing.
